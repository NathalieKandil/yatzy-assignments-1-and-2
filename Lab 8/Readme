Yahtzee Dice Game Project

Core Functionalities
1. Dice Representation
Each die is represented with an HTML element displaying the number of dots.
The dice default to displaying six dots on load.
The dice will update to show a random number between 1 and 6 each time theyâ€™re rolled.
2. Dice Rolling Animation and Random Value Display
jQuery is used for efficient DOM manipulation and event handling.
A button triggers the roll of the dice. On each click, the dice "roll" (animation) and then display a random number between 1 and 6 after the animation completes.
3. Event Handling with jQuery
The button is set up to handle events using jQuery.
The event listener is added to respond to a button click, which starts the rolling animation and random number assignment.
